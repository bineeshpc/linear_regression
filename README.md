## General Information
The dataset contains various independent variables related to weather, time, and other factors that might influence bike demand. The goal is to understand the significant variables affecting bike demand and create a model to predict it accurately.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Most important variables are 

1. temperature
2. Light Snow/Rain (weather code)
3. 2019 (year)
4. windspeed
5. humidity




## Technologies Used
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas
- numpy
- statsmodels
- scipy
- sklearn

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->
